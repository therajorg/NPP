Benefits To Entities

- Easy to move/replicate to different servers (as simple as copy and paste to new servers/locations).
- Ready to host on secure "https" sites.
- Edit the NPP content directly with NPP "Admin Editor" tool - as simple as editing a text document.

- Using Admin Editor tool the admin can easily edit:
  - Edit both "Provider" and "Plan" notices.

NOTE - DEMO vs. LIVE
Demo: The sites "http://theraj.org/nppdemo/" and "http://theraj.org/nppdemo/admin/" are setup as a demo for this challenge. To avoid accidental changes by public/reviewers/voters/etc. and to avoid confusion during review, the demo Admin Editor tool does not directly update the User facing site.
Live: The files in GitHub and attached "Website\npp\" folder contains live setup files, where the Admin Editor tool updates the User facing site directly. Try live version at "http://theraj.org/npp/" and "http://theraj.org/npp/admin/". The admin credentials for live site are same as the demo site.
